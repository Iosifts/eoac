Emotion Transfer with LangChain and Hugging Face

This project aims to transform neutral text sentences into emotionally charged versions using LangChain and Hugging Face's powerful language models. 
It leverages affective computing techniques to inject specified emotions into texts, 
making it a valuable tool for research in natural language processing, 
affective computing, and text style transfer.
